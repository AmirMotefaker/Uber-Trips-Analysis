So different kinds of people are using the services of Uber and other taxi services.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Uber Really Needs Lyft to Stay in the Rideshare Race\n\n- The long-held assumption about Uber Technologies Inc. has been that it would only make real money via one of two routes. \n\n- The first is self-driving cars become a reality and there’s no more need to pay human drivers. Well, forget that, ain’t gonna happen — at least not for many years.\n\n- The second scenario involves using aggressive price cuts to see off the competition before jacking up fares and cutting driver pay as soon as consumers and gig workers have few other options. \n\n- Are we at that point? Looking at the market today, you might think so. Having swiftly upended the taxi industry across the world, in recent months Uber has also stretched its domination over longtime US rival Lyft Inc., which has seen its market share fall to as little as 24% in March from around 33% pre-pandemic, according to data from Bloomberg Second Measure. \n\n### REF: [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-05-08/uber-needs-lyft-to-stay-in-the-rideshare-race)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.987687Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.988163Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.993026Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.988122Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.991941Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/uber-dataset-from-april-to-september-2014/Uber-dataset/uber-raw-data-sep14.csv/uber-raw-data-sep14.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.994901Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.995245Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T11:00:11.641519Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T11:00:10.995218Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T11:00:11.640663Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data[\"Date/Time\"] = data[\"Date/Time\"].map(pd.to_datetime) ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T11:00:11.642856Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T11:00:11.643421Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.759342Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T11:00:11.643392Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.758137Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.760282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.760568Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.772177Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.760544Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.770979Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- This data contains data about date and time, latitude and longitude, and a Base column that contains code affiliated with the Uber pickup.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data[\"Day\"] = data[\"Date/Time\"].apply(lambda x: x.day)\ndata[\"Weekday\"] = data[\"Date/Time\"].apply(lambda x: x.weekday())\ndata[\"Hour\"] = data[\"Date/Time\"].apply(lambda x: x.hour)\nprint(data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.774953Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.775354Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T11:03:41.438398Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T11:03:34.775322Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T11:03:41.437174Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Which day the Uber trips were highest?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- So I have prepared this data according to the days and hours, as I am using the Uber trips for September month so let’s have a look at each day to see on which day the Uber trips were highest:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(12, 10)})\n#sns.displot(data[\"Day\"])\nsns.distplot(data[\"Day\"])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T11:03:41.43969Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T11:03:41.440526Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T11:03:45.920083Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T11:03:41.440493Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T11:03:45.919033Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Uber trips according to the hours","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- By looking at the daily trips we can say that the Uber trips are rising on the working days and decreases on the weekends.
